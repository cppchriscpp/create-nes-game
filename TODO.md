TODO

* Config system complete

* config builder for game itself
* Build process for app itself
* Recurse through parent directories to find true working dir
* Create a small documentation site
* Create version update check, self-upgrade mechanism
* Figure out how to run as npx script
* Build into pkg and test that
* How can the user resize their rom?
* Can the user switch mappers non-manually?
* How can I install all of my tools in an already-created github repo?
  * Should `build` and `emu` trigger this if not done maybe?
* Create linux cc65 binaries (these have to be manually built, sigh.)
* Show a % complete or something like that, Explore using the bottom bar tool we have
* Install optional tools? (nesst or nexxt, space checker? Or implement our own sc)
* Cool post-build stats? eg size/free based on guessing at rom structure, symbol count? Etc
  * Give a reason to use this thing
* Think about a way to "eject" if you don't wanna use our tools. 
  * Don't compromise on folder structure though - maybe give a .sh that runs all commands we would
* make a choice on simplifying the example for ca65
